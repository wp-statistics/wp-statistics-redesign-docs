# First Touch Attribution

Entry page = first page ever viewed by visitor (constant across all sessions).

## Definition

Credits the first page from visitor's initial visit as the entry page for all future sessions. Emphasizes acquisition over ongoing behavior.

## How It Works

```
Session 1: Enter via Blog Post A → Entry = Blog Post A
Session 2: Enter via Homepage → Entry = Still Blog Post A
Session 3: Enter via Product → Entry = Still Blog Post A

All sessions credited to Blog Post A (first touch)
```

## Example Comparison

```
Visitor Journey:
- Jan 1: Google → Blog Post (first touch)
- Jan 15: Direct → Homepage
- Jan 30: Email → Product Page

First Touch Attribution:
- 3 sessions, all entry = Blog Post

Last Touch Attribution:
- Session 1 entry = Blog Post
- Session 2 entry = Homepage
- Session 3 entry = Product Page
```

## Use Cases

- **Acquisition analysis:** Which pages attract new visitors?
- **Marketing attribution:** Credit first touchpoint for customer value
- **SEO analysis:** Track organic discovery pages

## Date Range Behavior

Entry pages can be outside selected date range:
```
Date Range: January 2024
Visitor first visited: December 2023 via Blog Post X
January sessions: Entry = Blog Post X (from December)
```

## Common Misconceptions

**"First Touch tracks first page in each session"**
- No. That's Last Touch. First Touch = first page ever.

**"First Touch changes with date range"**
- No. Always the first page from visitor's very first visit.
