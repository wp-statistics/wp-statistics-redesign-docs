# Returning Visitor

Visitor who has visited before (all-time classification, permanent).

## Definition

Complement of "New Visitor". Any visitor whose IP exists in database from a previous visit.

```
New + Returning = All Visitors
```

## Classification Rule

```
Visit 1: New
Visit 2+: Returning (forever)
```

**Time gap irrelevant:** 2 years between visits = still "Returning"

## Example

```
Visit History:
- Jan 2023: First visit → New
- Dec 2024: Second visit → Returning

Date Range "December 2024":
- Shows: 1 Returning Visitor
- Even though 2 years passed

Multiple visits in one month:
- March 1: Visitor first visits → New
- March 15: Same visitor returns → Returning
- March 28: Same visitor returns → Returning
- March report: 1 visitor (new at start, returning for subsequent visits)
```

## Typical Distribution

- Content/Blog sites: 60-80% returning
- E-commerce: 40-60% returning
- New sites: 20-40% returning (growing)

## Common Misconceptions

**"High returning % means no growth"**
- No. Indicates loyalty. Track new visitor count separately for growth.

**"Returning visitors always convert better"**
- Often true, but depends on context and offer.
