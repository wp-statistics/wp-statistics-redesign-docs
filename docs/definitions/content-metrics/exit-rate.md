# Exit Rate

Percentage of page views that were the last page in a session.

## Definition

**Formula:**
```
Exit Rate = (Exits from Page ÷ Total Page Views) × 100
```

Exit rate measures how often a page is the last one viewed before a visitor leaves the website.

## Exit Rate vs Bounce Rate

| Metric | Scope | Calculation |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Exit Rate** | Any page | Exits ÷ All views of page |
| **Bounce Rate** | Entry pages only | Single-page sessions ÷ Sessions starting on page |

**Key difference:** Exit rate applies to all page views; bounce rate only applies to sessions that started on that page.

## Example

```
Page: /checkout/

Total Page Views: 500
Sessions that ended here: 150

Exit Rate = (150 ÷ 500) × 100 = 30%
```
