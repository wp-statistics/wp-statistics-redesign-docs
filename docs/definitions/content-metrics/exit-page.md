# Exit Page

Last page viewed before leaving or session ending.

## Definition

Final page in session before:
- Visitor leaves site
- 30-minute timeout
- Midnight boundary

## Exit Rate Formula

```
Exit Rate = (Exits from Page ÷ Total Page Views) × 100

Example:
- Contact page: 500 views, 300 exits
- Exit Rate = (300 ÷ 500) × 100 = 60%
```

## Exit Rate vs Bounce Rate

```
Bounce Rate: Entry AND exit on same page (entry pages only)
Exit Rate: Any page that was last in session (all pages)

All bounces are exits, but not all exits are bounces
```

## Common Misconceptions

**"High exit rate = bad page"**
- Context matters. Confirmation pages SHOULD have high exits.

**"Exit rate and bounce rate are the same"**
- No. Bounce rate is entry pages only.
