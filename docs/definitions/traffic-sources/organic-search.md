# Organic Search

Unpaid traffic from search engines (natural, non-ad results).

## Definition

Visitors who found your site through search engine results (not ads). Free, earned traffic based on SEO and ranking.

**Detection:**
- Referrer: google.com, bing.com, yahoo.com, duckduckgo.com
- No paid UTM parameters (not utm_medium=cpc)

## Organic vs Paid Search

```
Organic:
- Free (earned through SEO)
- Referrer: google.com, no UTM
- Long-term, sustainable

Paid (Google Ads):
- Paid advertising
- Should have: utm_medium=cpc
- Immediate, controllable
```

**Critical:** Always tag paid ads with UTM parameters, or they'll appear as organic.

New sites: 5-15%
Maturing sites: 30-50%
Strong SEO sites: 40-70%
```
