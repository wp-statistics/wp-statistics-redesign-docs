# Search Term

Words/phrases visitors use in WordPress site search.

## Definition

Text entered in WordPress built-in search functionality. Tracks what visitors are looking for on your site.

**Note:** This is NOT about search engine keywords (Google, Bing). This tracks internal site search only.

## What WP Statistics Tracks

- Search query text
- Frequency of each search term
- Date/time of searches
- Number of results returned

## Example

```
Visitor searches: "contact form plugin"
- WP Statistics records: "contact form plugin"
- Shows what content visitors need
- Helps identify content gaps

Popular searches:
- "pricing" (100 searches) → Need clearer pricing page
- "documentation" (75 searches) → Improve docs visibility
- "api" (50 searches) → Create API documentation
```

## Common Misconceptions

**"Search terms show Google keywords"**
- No. Shows internal WordPress search only, not search engine data.
