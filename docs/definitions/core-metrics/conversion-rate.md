# Conversion Rate

Percentage of sessions that completed a defined goal.

## Definition

**Formula:**
```
Conversion Rate = (Conversions ÷ Total Sessions) × 100
```

A conversion occurs when a visitor completes a tracked goal, such as submitting a form, clicking a specific button, or reaching a thank-you page.

## Example

```
Total Sessions: 1,000
Form Submissions: 50

Conversion Rate = (50 ÷ 1,000) × 100 = 5%
```

## Goal Types

Common conversion goals:
- Form submissions
- Button clicks
- Page visits (e.g., reaching checkout)
- Downloads
- Sign-ups
